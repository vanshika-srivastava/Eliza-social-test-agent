# Welcome to Circles

Circles is a decentralized, sybil-resistant protocol designed to create and distribute fair and social money through personal currencies. At the core of the Circles project lies a simple yet powerful principle:

`"Every person receives one Circle every hour, unconditionally."`

**Circles** uses smart contracts, deployed on Gnosis Chain, for creation of personal and group Avatars and their currencies (CRC). Circles as a network works via trust connection. To join Circles 2.0, you would require an invitation from a human/personal avatar. The pathfinder service is deployed to find the optimal path between trust connections to exchange the personal and group currencies. Circles smart contracts are based on ERC1155 multi-token standard for both personal avatars and group avatars.&#x20;

Every person is bound to receive 1 CRC every hour, hence 24 CRC in a single day. Circles undergo daily demurrage at a rate equivalent to 7% per year. Issuance for past days accounts for this demurrage, ensuring fair distribution over time.

**This documentation will guide developers to understand about Avatars and using Circles SDK**
