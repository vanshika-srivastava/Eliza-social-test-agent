# The Circles Stack

Our developer documentation portal provides comprehensive guides, SDK references, contract addresses, and code examples to help you integrate Circles into your applications and build upon our ecosystem.

## Circles SDK

If you want to develop a server or client application that utilizes Circles, and allow you to utilize trust connection and personal/group currencies, then Circles SDK would be your entry point. Based on your need, you can pick to develop any avatar post initialization of SDK.

* [Circles SDK package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@circles-sdk/sdk)
* [Circles SDK source code](https://github.com/aboutcircles/circles-sdk)

The SDK allows you to seamlessly use all features of **Circles V1** and **Circles V2**. These include:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sign Up</strong></td><td>Sign up as a human, organization, or group effortlessly using Circles v1 and Circles v2 features.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Trust, Mint &#x26; Transfer</strong></td><td>Trust, mint, and transfer personal and group Circles seamlessly.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Query Data</strong></td><td>Query balances, trust relations, and transaction histories with ease.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Subscribe &#x26; Query Events</strong></td><td>Subscribe to and query events within the Circles network.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Circles Infrastructure

Circles relies on some infrastructure components to make it work.&#x20;

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pathfinder</strong></td><td><p>Finds liquid paths between two accounts in the trust network. These paths are used as input for the contract's transfer methods.<br></p><p><a href="https://github.com/circlesUBI/pathfinder2">Learn more about Pathfinder</a></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Circles Nethermind Plug-in</strong></td><td><p>Provides access to the Gnosis Chain and indexes Circles events for a seamless experience.<br></p><p><a href="https://github.com/aboutcircles/circles-nethermind-plugin">Learn more about Circles Nethermind Plug-in</a></p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Contracts

Incase, the circles SDK is not something that you can directly use in your application, you can also utilize the deployed contracts directly. In this case you can check out the source code on GitHub.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Circles V1 contract source code</strong></td><td><p>Review the codebase for Circles Contracts V1, including all core features and specifications related to Hub Contract and minting.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://github.com/circlesubi/circles-contracts/">Circles V1 Contract code</a></p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Circles V2 Reference docs</strong></td><td><p>Explore the latest updates and functionalities of Circles v2.0 Contracts with detailed documentation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://aboutcircles.github.io/circles-contracts-v2/">Circles V2 Reference docs</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Circles V2 contract source code</strong></td><td>Review the codebase for Circles contracts V2 which follows ERC1155 standard, and manages personal, group and organisation avatars.</td></tr></tbody></table>
