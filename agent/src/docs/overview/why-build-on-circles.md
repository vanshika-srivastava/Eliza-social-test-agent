# Why Build on Circles?

Circles is a sybil resistant protocol with a  social eccentric value for human, communities and groups. Circles is not a crypto startup or product in general, but a collective effort to bring a fair distribution model for the money created, owned and shared by the people. This incentivizes the network effect and the ones who participate in it. With it's unique utility of socio-economic fulfillment, one can bring adoption on different levels.

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Each user generates tokens continuously at a rate of one Circle (CRC) per hour, ensuring equal opportunity regardless of when they join. This promotes fairness as everyone has a chance to accumulate Circles.</td></tr><tr><td>Circles operates on a trust-based model, forming a social graph where users trust each other's CRC tokens. Trusted tokens become fungible, creating a dynamic economy backed by genuine social connections.</td></tr><tr><td>Circles integrates a demurrage mechanism, applying a 7% annual fee on held tokens. This keeps the currency circulating, benefiting the overall economy and promoting continuous engagement within the community. For most human users, the fee is offset by the steady income of 1 CRC per hour. Organizations always have to pay the fee.</td></tr><tr><td>By decentralising the verification process and leveraging human judgement for trust, Circles addresses the issue of fake accounts. This fosters a secure and resilient ecosystem, where the authenticity of each user is ensured by their social connections rather than centralised authorities or algorithms.</td></tr><tr><td>Circles v2 allows for the creation of group currencies, enabling communities to share a currency that's backed by their members' personal tokens. This reduces risk, simplifies payments, and enhances market creation by aggregating individual tokens into a more stable group currency that's easy to integrate into existing protocols.</td></tr><tr><td>By joining the Circles developer community, you can play a crucial role in building a more equitable and inclusive financial system. You can build, support developers and invite more people to join your trust network.</td></tr></tbody></table>
