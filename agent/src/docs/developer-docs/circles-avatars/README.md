# Circles Avatars

The SDK is built around the concept of avatars. An avatar is a Circles user and is used to interact with other Avatars.&#x20;

* For new Circles users, you would require them to Sign up.
* For existing Circles users, you can simply get exisiting avatars by address.

### Creating a new avatar
